Test that our solutions to list-slicing behave as intended.

First, let's import the doctest module, so we can actually run our tests.

    >>> import doctest

Now, import the files we'll want to test:

    >>> import list_operations
    >>> import further_study

Assuming they've imported with no syntax errors, now we should be able
to run the doctests.

First, check the basic solution:

    >>> doctest.testmod(list_operations).failed
    0

Now, check the Further Study.

    >>> doctest.testmod(further_study).failed
    0
